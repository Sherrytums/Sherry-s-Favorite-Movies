Source code for a Movie Trailer website.


This is a website that shows my favorite movies. It displays trailers of the movies when a movie is clicked on.

How to:

Run the entertainment_center.py module.
An HTML file will automatically be generated by the fresh_tomatoes.py module.

A web browser page with the movie website will be automatically opened.
